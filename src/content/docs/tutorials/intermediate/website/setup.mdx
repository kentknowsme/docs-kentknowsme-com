## Introduction

Create the project directory and the three source files your site requires. By the end,
you will have a working scaffold — empty, yes, but structurally ready for content.
Blank files have a certain optimistic quality to them.

## What You Are Building

Throughout this tutorial you will build a single-page personal profile site. The
finished page will include:

- A sticky top navigation bar with internal anchor links
- A hero section with a name, title, tagline, and scroll indicator
- An "About" section with a short bio
- A skills grid displaying technology tags
- A contact form with name, email, and message fields
- A footer with copyright text

The entire site lives in one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file. No build
tools, no package manager, no framework, no opinions about which framework you should
have used instead. Open the HTML file in a browser and it works.

## Prerequisites

- A text editor installed — see [Website Basics](/tutorials/build/basics/) for recommendations
- A terminal or CLI environment
- A web browser
- Approximately fifteen minutes and a reasonable tolerance for angle brackets

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>

### Create the Project Directory

Choose a parent directory where you keep development projects, then create a new folder.
Keep the name lowercase with hyphens and no spaces — spaces in directory names are
technically allowed and practically regrettable.

**CLI (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/my-profile-site
cd ~/projects/my-profile-site
```

**CLI (Windows PowerShell):**

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$HOME\projects\my-profile-site"
Set-Location "$HOME\projects\my-profile-site"
```

**GUI equivalent:** Open Finder or File Explorer, navigate to your projects folder,
and create a new folder named `my-profile-site`.

---

### Create the Source Files

Three empty files are all you need. One command handles all of them:

**CLI (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
touch index.html style.css script.js
```

**CLI (Windows PowerShell):**

```powershell
New-Item index.html, style.css, script.js -ItemType File
```

**GUI equivalent:** In VS Code, use `File > New File` three times, saving each with the
appropriate name and extension into the project folder.

<Aside type="caution" title="Filename matters">
  The CSS file in this tutorial is named `style.css` — not `styles.css`. The name must
  match exactly what is referenced in the `<link>` tag inside `index.html`. A one-letter
  difference is all it takes to spend twenty minutes wondering why your CSS is not loading.
</Aside>

---

### Verify the Structure

Confirm all three files exist before moving on — catching a typo in a filename now is
much less frustrating than debugging a missing stylesheet reference later:

**CLI:**

```bash
ls -1
```

Expected output:

```
index.html
script.js
style.css
```

Your project tree should look like this:

<FileTree>
- my-profile-site/
  - index.html
  - style.css
  - script.js
</FileTree>

<Aside type="tip">
  Open the project folder in your editor now so all three files are visible in the file
  tree. In VS Code: `code .` from within the project directory. Future you will
  appreciate not hunting for files mid-tutorial.
</Aside>

### (Optional) Initialize a Git Repository

Version control is not required to finish this tutorial, but initializing a repo now
costs thirty seconds and gives you a full rollback history as you build. When you
inevitably want to undo something, you will be glad it is there.[^1]

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project scaffold"
```

<Aside type="note">
  If Git is not installed, skip this step — it has no effect on the tutorial output.
  Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) when you are ready.
</Aside>

### (Optional) Start a Local HTTP Server

Opening `index.html` directly via the browser works fine for everything in this
tutorial. If you later add `fetch()` calls or ES module imports, browser CORS policy
will block them over the `file://` protocol. The fix is straightforward — serve the
files over HTTP instead:

**Python 3 (built-in, no install needed):**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

**Node.js (npx, also no install needed):**

```bash
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Both do the same job — serve your project folder as a local website. Pick whichever
runtime you already have installed. Running a web server on your own machine sounds
more impressive at parties than it probably should.

</Steps>

## Summary

You now have a project directory at `~/projects/my-profile-site/` containing three
empty, correctly named, UTF-8 plain-text files. The scaffold is ready. Next up: filling
`index.html` with a valid HTML5 document structure — which is where things start
to actually look like a website.
