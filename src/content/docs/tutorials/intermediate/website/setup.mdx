import { Steps, Aside, Code, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Introduction

In this step you will create the project directory and the three source files your site requires.
By the end you will have a working scaffold — empty, yes, but *structurally* valid and
ready for content. Empty files have a certain optimistic quality to them.

## What You Are Building

Throughout this tutorial you will construct a single-page personal profile site.
The finished page will include:

- A sticky top navigation bar with internal anchor links
- A hero section with a name, title, and brief tagline
- An "About" section with a short bio paragraph
- A skills grid displaying technology tags
- A contact form with name, email, and message fields
- A footer with copyright text

The entire site lives in one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file.
No build tools, no package manager, no framework, no opinions about which framework
you should have used instead. Open the HTML file in a browser and it works.

## Prerequisites

- A text editor installed (VS Code recommended — see [Website Basics](/tutorials/build/basics/))
- A terminal or CLI environment
- A web browser
- Approximately fifteen minutes and a reasonable tolerance for angle brackets

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>

### Create the Project Directory

Choose a parent directory where you keep development projects, then create a new
folder for this site. The folder name becomes your project identifier — keep it
lowercase with hyphens, no spaces. Spaces in directory names are technically allowed
and yet very regrettable.

**CLI:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/my-profile-site
cd ~/projects/my-profile-site
```

**GUI equivalent:** Open Finder or File Explorer, navigate to your projects folder,
and create a new folder named `my-profile-site`.

### Create the Source Files

Three empty files are all you need. One command handles all of them:

**CLI (bash/zsh):**

```bash
touch index.html style.css script.js
```

**CLI (PowerShell/Windows):**

```powershell
New-Item index.html, style.css, script.js -ItemType File
```

**GUI equivalent:** In VS Code, use `File > New File` three times, saving each with
the appropriate name and extension into the project folder. It is slightly more
ceremonial but equally valid.

### Verify the Structure

Confirm all three files exist before continuing — catching a typo in a filename now
is much less annoying than debugging a missing stylesheet reference twenty minutes later:

```bash
ls -1
```

Expected output:

```bash
index.html
script.js
style.css
```

Your project tree should look like this:

<FileTree>
- my-profile-site/
  - index.html
  - style.css
  - script.js
</FileTree>

<Aside type="tip">
  Open the project folder in your editor now so all three files are visible in the
  file tree. In VS Code: `code .` from within the project directory. Future you
  will appreciate not hunting for files mid-tutorial.
</Aside>

### (Optional) Initialize a Git Repository

Version control is not required to finish this tutorial, but initializing a repo
now costs thirty seconds and gives you a full rollback history as you build.
When you inevitably want to undo something, you will be glad it is there.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project scaffold"
```

<Aside type="note">
  If Git is not installed, skip this step — it has no effect on the tutorial output.
  If you want Git but do not have it, the [Git download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  will sort you out, or at least get you started.
</Aside>

### (Optional) Start a Local HTTP Server

Opening `index.html` directly via the browser works fine for everything in this tutorial.
If you later add `fetch()` calls or ES module imports, browser CORS policy will stop you
cold with an error that looks alarming but is actually a straightforward fix: serve the
files over HTTP instead of the `file://` protocol.

**Python 3 (built-in, no install needed):**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

**Node.js (npx, also no install needed):**

```bash
npx serve .
```

Both serve the current directory locally — Python at `http://localhost:8080`,
`serve` at `http://localhost:3000`. Open that URL in your browser and you are
running a real web server on your own machine, which sounds more impressive at
parties than it probably should.

</Steps>

## Summary

You have a project directory at `~/projects/my-profile-site/` with three empty,
correctly named, UTF-8 plain-text files. The scaffold is ready. Next up: filling
`index.html` with a valid HTML5 document structure — which is where things start
to look like an actual website.
