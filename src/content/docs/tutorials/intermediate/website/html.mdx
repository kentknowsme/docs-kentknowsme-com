## Introduction

HTML is the skeleton of every web page. It is not pretty on its own — and that is fine,
because making it pretty is CSS's job. Your job right now is to build a solid structure
that holds everything together: the navigation, the hero section, the about blurb, the
skills grid, the contact form, and the footer.

Think of HTML like framing a house. You are not painting walls or picking carpet yet.
You are just making sure the rooms are in the right places and the doors actually lead
somewhere useful.

By the end of this step, opening `index.html` in a browser will show you a plain,
unstyled page with real content on it. If it looks like something from 1996, then you have
done it correctly.

---

## One File or Three?

Before writing a single tag, you have a choice to make about *where* your CSS and
JavaScript code will live.

**The recommended approach — three separate files:**

- `index.html` — your content and structure
- `style.css` — your visual design
- `script.js` — your interactive behavior

Keeping them separate is the standard way professionals build websites. It keeps each
file focused, easier to read, and easier to fix when something breaks (and something
will always break).

**The single-file approach — everything in `index.html`:**

CSS goes inside a `<style>` block in the `<head>` section. JavaScript goes inside a 
`<script>` block at the bottom of `<body>`. It works, and for small personal projects 
it is not a crime. It just gets messy fast, like cooking an entire meal in one pan — 
totally doable, but you will regret it when cleanup time comes.

<Aside type="tip" title="Which should you pick?">
  Follow the three-file approach in this tutorial. The single-file option is shown
  alongside each relevant step so you know how it works, but the main instructions
  assume separate files. Future tutorials build on that structure.
</Aside>

## The HTML Boilerplate

Every HTML file starts with the same basic skeleton. Most editors can generate it
automatically, but take a few minutes to understand what each piece actually does.
Copy-pasting code you do not understand is a lot like casting a spell you found in
a library book — it might work, or you might end up transported *diagonally* instead
of to Diagon Alley.[^3]

Open `index.html` in your editor and type (or paste) this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Profile</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- Your page content goes here -->

    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here is what each line does:

**`<!DOCTYPE html>`** — Tells the browser this is a modern HTML5 document. Not a tag,
just a declaration. Leave it as the very first line, always.

**`<html lang="en">`** — The root element that wraps everything. The `lang` attribute
tells browsers and screen readers what language the page is in. Change `"en"` if you are
writing in another language — for example, `"es"` for Spanish, `"fr"` for French, or
`"ja"` for Japanese.[^4][^5]

**`<meta charset="UTF-8" />`** — Sets the character encoding. Without this, special
characters like `é`, `ñ`, or `"smart quotes"` can turn into random garbage symbols.
UTF-8 handles basically every character on earth, so just use it.

**`<meta name="viewport" ...>`** — This one line is what makes your page not look
terrible on a phone. Without it, mobile browsers zoom out and render your site as if it
were being viewed through a telescope. Include it on every page, no exceptions.

<Aside type="note" title="Meta Tags Do a Lot More">
  The `<meta>` tag has uses well beyond charset and viewport — Open Graph tags for social
  media previews, SEO description tags, cache control, theme colors, and more all live
  here. That rabbit hole is outside the scope of this tutorial, but **MDN's meta element reference** [^6]
  is the best place to explore them when you are ready.
</Aside>

**`<title>My Profile</title>`** — The text that appears on the browser tab. Change
it to Me or whatever fits your page. It is also what shows up in search results,
so make it something meaningful.

**`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`** — Connects your CSS file to the page.
The `href` value must exactly match your CSS filename, including capitalization.

**`<script src="script.js" defer></script>`** — Loads your JavaScript file. The `defer`
attribute tells the browser to wait until the rest of the page is fully loaded before
running the script. Put this at the bottom of `<body>`, not in `<head>`. If you put it
in `<head>` without `defer`, your script will try to interact with elements that do not
exist yet, which causes errors that are confusing to debug at any hour.

---

### Single-File Version of the Boilerplate

If you are going the everything-in-one-file route, replace the `<link>` and `<script>`
tags with embedded blocks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Profile</title>
    <style>
      /* Your CSS goes here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>

    <!-- Your page content goes here -->

    <script>
      // Your JavaScript goes here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Everything else in this tutorial is identical. When you see `style.css`, write it inside
`<style>`. When you see `script.js`, write it inside `<script>`. Easy enough.

---

## Building the Page Sections

Now fill in the `<!-- Your page content goes here -->` area with the actual page sections.
Add them in order — HTML renders top to bottom, so the order in the file is the order
on screen.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is a list of links that jump to different sections of the same page.
When a link says `href="#about"`, the browser scrolls to whatever element has `id="about"`.
That connection — from the `href` in the nav to the `id` on a section — is how the whole
single-page navigation works. Mess up the spelling on either end and the link goes nowhere,
quietly, without an error message.

```html
<nav id="navbar">
  <div class="nav-logo">Me</div>
  <ul class="nav-links">
    <li><a href="#hero">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#skills">Skills</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

<Aside type="note">
  The `<nav>` element tells browsers, screen readers, and search engines "this is
  the navigation bar." You could use a `<div>` and it would look identical — but `<nav>` refers
  specifically to a navigation section. Using the right element for the right job is called 
  writing *semantic HTML*, and it is a good habit to keep clean, working code.
</Aside>

---

### Main Content Wrapper

Before the hero section, add a `<main>` tag. It closes just before `<footer>`. Everything
in between — hero, about, skills, contact — lives inside it.

```html
<main>
  <!-- Hero, About, Skills, and Contact sections go here -->
</main>
```

That is it. One opening tag, one closing tag, and suddenly every browser, screen reader,
and search engine crawler knows exactly where the primary content of your page is.
Screen readers use `<main>` to offer a "skip to main content" shortcut so keyboard users
do not have to tab through the entire nav on every page load. You get that for free just
by using the right element.

There should be exactly one `<main>` per page — same rule as `<h1>`.

---

### Hero Section

The hero section is the first thing visitors see — the big splashy area at the top with
your name and a one-liner about who you are or what you do. This is your digital handshake,
so make it count. Or at least make it not embarrassing.

```html
<header id="hero">
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h1>Hi, I'm Me</h1>
    <p class="hero-tagline">I build things for the web — and occasionally break them too.</p>
    <a href="#about" class="hero-button">Read More About Me</a>
    <a href="#contact" class="hero-button">Get In Touch</a>
  </div>
</header>
```

**Why `<header>` and not `<section>`?** The top hero area is semantically the
introductory header of the page, so `<header>` fits. Either works visually, but
`<header>` carries more meaning. One `<h1>` per page is the rule — it is the headline,
the main event. Everything else on the page uses `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and so on in order.
Skipping heading levels (going from `<h1>` straight to `<h3>`) confuses screen readers
and is generally considered bad form.

---

### About Section

Short, human, and written in first person. This is where you tell people who you are
in a short paragraph. Nobody reads walls of text here — they just want to know
if you are interesting enough to scroll further.

```html
<section id="about">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a web developer based in [Your City] with a passion for building clean,
      fast, accessible websites. When I'm not writing code, I'm probably drinking
      too much coffee and dreaming or creating strong opinions about text editors.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

The `<section>` element groups a thematic block of content. The `<div class="container">`
inside it is just a wrapper we will use in CSS to control the max width and center the
content. It has no semantic meaning — it is purely a styling hook. It also helps group
lots of content into manageable sections together on the page - useful for when
troubleshooting page issues.

---

### Skills Grid

List out the technologies, tools, or skills you want to highlight. Right now this will
look like a plain unformatted word list. The CSS step turns it into a clean tag grid - note
the `class` tags in the `div` and `span` elements.

```html
<section id="skills">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div class="skills-grid">
      <span class="skill-tag">HTML5</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">CSS3</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">JavaScript</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">Git</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">Responsive Design</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">VS Code</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">Command Line</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">Web Development</span>
      <span class="skill-tag">Problem Solving</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Replace or add to these with your actual skills. "Problem Solving" is on the list
  because it is genuinely useful and every hiring manager has seen it on a résumé.
  Feel free to swap it for something more specific to you.
</Aside>

### Contact Form

The contact form is where visitors can send you a message. Right now it does not
actually *send* anything — that requires a backend service, which is a topic for
another tutorial. What it will do, after the JavaScript step, is validate the fields
and give the user feedback. That is still useful, and it looks fully functional.

```html
<section id="contact">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
    <p>Have a question or want to work together? Fill out the form below.</p>
    <form id="contact-form" novalidate>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Your full name" />
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="you@example.com" />
      </div>
      <div class="form-group">
        <label for="message">Message</label>
        <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="5" placeholder="What's on your mind?"></textarea>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" class="submit-button">Send Message</button>
      <p id="form-feedback" class="form-feedback hidden"></p>
    </form>
  </div>
</section>
```

A few things worth pointing out here:

**`<label for="name">` paired with `<input id="name">`** — The `for` attribute on the
label must match the `id` on the input. This links them together so that clicking the
label text also focuses the input field. It is a small thing that makes the form much
nicer to use on mobile, and it is required for screen readers to work correctly.

**`novalidate` on `<form>`** — This turns off the browser's built-in validation popups
so your custom JavaScript validation (added in the next step) is the only thing that
runs. Without `novalidate`, the browser and your script will both try to validate the
form and argue about it. you do not want to the them fight - unless you have a reason
to want more therapy!

**`<p id="form-feedback" class="form-feedback hidden">`** — This paragraph is invisible
by default (CSS will handle the `hidden` class). The JavaScript step will put a success
or error message here and reveal it when the form is submitted. It is sitting here now
so the JS has something to find.

---

### Footer

Short, simple, and at the bottom. A copyright line and maybe a link or two.

```html
<footer id="footer">
  <div class="container">
    <p>&copy; 2025 Me. All rights reserved.</p>
  </div>
</footer>
```

`&copy;` is an HTML *entity* — a special code for the © symbol. It works in every
browser and every character encoding. Typing the symbol directly also works in UTF-8,
but using the entity is the safer habit if you ever end up working with older systems
that have encoding quirks.

## Full index.html Listing

Here is the complete file assembled in one place. If you have been building along
section by section, compare yours to this and make sure nothing is missing or out of order.
If you are just starting, copy this whole block and then go back and read the section
explanations — understanding what you pasted is more useful than typing it blind.

    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Aside type="note" title="Single-File Reminder">
  If you are using the single-file approach, replace `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`
  with `<style> /* CSS goes here */ </style>` in the `<head>`, and replace
  `<script src="script.js" defer></script>` with `<script> // JS goes here </script>`
  just before `</body>`. All the HTML in between stays exactly the same.
</Aside>

## Save and Take a Peek

Save `index.html`, open it in your browser, and take a look. You will see plain black
text on a white background with no spacing or styling. It will look rough. That is not
broken — that is HTML doing its job by itself with no CSS to help it.

Click one of the nav links. If it scrolls to (or jumps to) the right section, the
anchor link connections are working. That is real functionality right there, with zero
JavaScript and zero CSS.

<Aside type="tip">
  If a nav link does nothing when you click it, open your browser's developer tools
  (press **F12**), click the **Console** tab, and look for errors. Usually it means
  the `href` value on the link does not exactly match the `id` on the section.
  Capitalization counts — `#About` and `#about` are two different targets as far as
  the browser is concerned.
</Aside>

## What You Learned

- Every HTML page starts with the same boilerplate — DOCTYPE, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- The viewport meta tag is the one line standing between your page and a terrible mobile experience
- Semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` give structure meaning beyond just looks — and `<main>` is what screen readers use to skip straight to your content
- Anchor links connect `href="#id"` in the nav to `id="id"` on a section — match them exactly
- Labels and inputs need matching `for`/`id` pairs to work correctly for all users
- The single-file approach (CSS in `<style>`, JS in `<script>`) works but does not scale well

## Next Steps

- Proceed to [Add CSS Styling](/tutorials/build/styling/) — where this wall of unstyled
text gets an actual personality.
