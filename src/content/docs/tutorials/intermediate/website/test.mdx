## Introduction

You just built something! Now make sure it actually works.

Open a browser, open the index.html file, click around, resize the window, and 
see what happens. The goal is to catch anything that looks broken or feels off 
before you share the files or link with anyone else.

This step walks through a structured review so you do not miss anything obvious.
Think of it less like a formal inspection and more like a quick walk-through of a
room before guests arrive — just making sure nothing embarrassing is on the floor.

## See a Live Example

Not sure what the finished page is supposed to look like? Here is a working demo
built from exactly the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this tutorial — placeholder
content and all. Open it alongside your own file and compare section by section.

<Aside type="tip" title="Live Demo">
  See a finished version of this page at <a href="https://dev.kentknowsme.com/projects/simple-web-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev.kentknowsme.com/projects/simple-web-site</a> — built from the same three files covered in this tutorial.

## Open the Page

<Steps>

### Open index.html in your browser

**From the CLI:**

```bash
open index.html        # macOS
xdg-open index.html    # Linux
start index.html       # Windows
```

**From the GUI:** Double-click `index.html` in Finder or File Explorer. Your default
browser will open it.

The URL in your address bar will look something like `file:///Users/yourname/projects/my-profile-site/index.html`.
That `file://` prefix means the browser is reading directly from your disk rather than
a web server — which is perfectly fine for everything built in this tutorial.

### (Optional) Serve it over HTTP instead

If you added any `fetch()` calls or ES module imports beyond what is in this tutorial,
the browser's security policy will block them over `file://`. Run a local server instead:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. Everything works the same way,
just served the proper way.

**Node.js (npx, also no install needed):**

```bash
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Both do the same job — pick whichever runtime you already have available.

</Steps>

## Visual Checklist

Work through the page top to bottom. For each item, if something looks off, the
**Common Issues** section at the bottom has likely seen it before.

### Navigation Bar

- [ ] Nav bar is visible at the top of the page on first load
- [ ] Logo text (your name) appears on the left
- [ ] Nav links appear on the right and are horizontally aligned
- [ ] Nav bar stays at the top of the screen when you scroll down
- [ ] A subtle shadow appears under the nav once you scroll past the hero section

### Hero Section

- [ ] Hero fills the full height of the viewport on first load
- [ ] Your name appears as the large heading
- [ ] Tagline text is visible below the heading
- [ ] "Get In Touch" button is visible and readable against the background gradient
- [ ] Nothing is cut off or overflowing on a normal desktop window

### About Section

- [ ] Section heading is visible
- [ ] Body text is readable and not stretched too wide on a large monitor
- [ ] Background is a clean white (or your chosen color), distinct from the hero above it

### Skills Section

## Responsive Checklist

Drag the corner of your browser window and slowly make it narrower. Watch the layout
respond as it crosses each breakpoint. You are looking for anything that breaks,
overlaps, or becomes unreadable.

<Aside type="tip">
  A faster way to test multiple screen sizes is through browser DevTools. Press **F12**,
  then click the device toolbar icon (it looks like a phone and tablet overlapping) near
  the top of the DevTools panel. You can then pick from common device presets or type in
  any width you want. Toggle it off when you are done and the browser goes back to normal.
</Aside>

### Tablet width (~768px)

- [ ] Nav links stack below the logo instead of sitting side by side
- [ ] Heading font sizes reduce to fit the smaller width
- [ ] Hero content is still centered and readable
- [ ] Skills grid has fewer columns than at full width
- [ ] Form fields are still full-width

### Mobile width (~480px)

- [ ] All text is readable without zooming
- [ ] No content is cut off or requires horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Skill tags wrap cleanly into a compact two-column or three-column grid
- [ ] The hero tagline text is smaller but still readable
- [ ] The contact form and its button are easy to tap (nothing is too small or too close together)

## Functional Checklist

Now test the JavaScript behaviors. Each one should work cleanly and without any
visible hiccups.

### Nav Scroll Shadow

1. Load the page and look at the nav — no shadow visible at the top
2. Scroll down a few pixels
3. ✅ A soft shadow should appear under the nav bar
4. Scroll back to the very top
5. ✅ Shadow disappears again

### Smooth Scroll Navigation

1. Click each nav link one at a time
2. ✅ The page should scroll smoothly to the correct section
3. ✅ The section heading should land below the nav bar, not hidden behind it
4. Try clicking the **Get In Touch** button in the hero
5. ✅ Should scroll smoothly to the contact section

### Contact Form — Empty Submission

1. Leave all fields blank and click **Send Message**
2. ✅ An error message should appear in red below the button
3. ✅ The page should not reload

### Contact Form — Invalid Email

1. Type something in Name and Message, but put `notanemail` in the Email field
2. Click **Send Message**
3. ✅ An error message about the email address should appear

### Contact Form — Successful Submission

1. Fill in all three fields with valid values (use any real-looking email address)
2. Click **Send Message**
3. ✅ A green success message should appear
4. ✅ All three fields should clear themselves automatically

## Cross-Browser Testing

Your page should look and behave consistently across browsers. Test in at least two:

<Aside type="note">
  You do not need every browser installed. Chrome and Firefox together cover the vast
  majority of what people use. Safari testing matters most if you expect visitors on
  iPhones or Macs, since Safari is the only browser allowed on iOS devices — yes, even
  Chrome on an iPhone is actually Safari underneath. It's a long story.[^1]
</Aside>

Open your `index.html` in each browser you have available and run through the visual
and functional checklists again. You are mostly looking for anything that looks
noticeably different — layout shifts, colors that do not match, hover states that do
not fire. Small rendering differences between browsers are normal and usually not worth
chasing. Anything that is completely broken is worth a fix.

## Common Issues and Fixes

Things do not always work on the first try, and that is completely normal. Here are
the most common problems and what to do about them:

### CSS is not loading — page looks unstyled

Check that the `<link>` tag in `index.html` matches your actual filename exactly:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

Common culprits: a capital letter somewhere (`Style.css`), a typo (`styles.css`),
or the file saved in the wrong folder. Both files need to be in the same directory.

### JavaScript is not running

Open DevTools (F12) and click the **Console** tab. Any JavaScript error will appear
there in red with the filename and line number. Read it — the message is usually
more helpful than it looks at first glance. Then check that your `<script>` tag
at the bottom of `<body>` matches the actual filename:

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

### A nav link does nothing when clicked

The `href` on the link and the `id` on the target section do not match. They are
case-sensitive — `href="#About"` and `id="about"` are two different things.
Go back to `index.html` and compare them character by character.

### The section heading lands behind the nav bar

This means the smooth scroll offset is not accounting for the nav height correctly.
Double-check the scroll behavior in `script.js` — the `navHeight` calculation uses
`navbar.offsetHeight`, which only works if the `navbar` variable is pointing to the
right element. A quick `console.log(navbar)` will confirm it.

### The form reloads the page on submit

`event.preventDefault()` is either missing or not being called. Check that the
event listener is attached to the `<form>` element itself (with `id="contact-form"`),
not to the submit button. The `submit` event fires on the form, not the button.

### Skills tags are showing as a single vertical list

The CSS grid is not applying. Check that the `<div class="skills-grid">` in `index.html`
matches the `.skills-grid` selector in `style.css`, including the class name spelling.

### Everything looks fine in Chrome but something is off in Safari

Safari occasionally handles newer CSS features differently, especially around flexbox
gap and certain gradient syntaxes. Open Safari's DevTools (`Develop > Show Web Inspector`),
find the element in question, and check which CSS rules are being applied or ignored.
[Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) is the go-to reference for checking which browsers
support a specific CSS or JavaScript feature.

## You Are Done

Seriously — nice work. You started with three empty files and ended up with a
real, working, responsive single-page website built from scratch. That is not a small
thing, even if it feels like it right now.

Here is a quick recap of everything covered across this tutorial:

- **HTML** gave the page structure and meaning — semantic elements, anchor links, form fields, and a layout the browser could understand
- **CSS** gave it personality — a layout system, a color scheme, responsive breakpoints, and hover effects that make it feel intentional
- **JavaScript** made it interactive — a live nav shadow, smooth scrolling, and form validation that gives users real feedback

The three files talk to each other through class names and IDs. CSS reads the classes
you write in HTML. JavaScript toggles those same classes based on what the user does.
Keep that mental model and a lot of future web development will click into place
more easily than you expect.

## What's Next

The page works — now there are a few natural directions to take it:

**Deploy it** so it has a real URL you can share. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com),
[Netlify](https://netlify.com), and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
are all free for personal projects and take less than ten minutes to set up.

**Wire up the contact form** using [Formspree](https://formspree.io) or
[Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) so it actually sends email. No backend required.

**Make it yours** — swap in your real name, bio, skills, and colors. The tutorial
content is placeholder; the structure is yours to keep.

**Keep learning** — the natural next steps from here are:

- [Advanced CSS Techniques](/docs/tutorials/advanced-css/) — animations, custom scrollbars, dark mode
- [WCAG Accessibility Fundamentals](/docs/tutorials/accessability/) — how to make your site more accessible
- [JavaScript Fundamentals](/docs/tutorials/javascript-basics/) — a deeper look at the language itself
- [Deploying Your Website](/docs/guides/deploy-site/) — a step-by-step guide to going live

[^1]: Apple requires all browsers distributed through the iOS App Store to use the WebKit rendering engine — the same engine that powers Safari. So Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on an iPhone are effectively Safari with a different coat of paint. This matters for testing because a bug that only appears in Safari on desktop will almost certainly also appear on every iPhone, regardless of which browser app the visitor is using. This requirement is spelled out in [section 2.5.6 of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements).
