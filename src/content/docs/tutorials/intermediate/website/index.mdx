## Introduction

Follow the steps below to build your first web page from scratch. No prior coding
experience required — just a computer, a text editor, and a little patience.
Each step builds on the last, so work through them in order.

<Aside type="note" title="Intermediate Tutorial — How This Differs from the Basic Tutorial">
  If you have already completed the [Build Your First Website](/tutorials/first-website/)
  basic tutorial, welcome back. This intermediate version covers the same three-layer
  approach (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but goes deeper in several areas:

  - **Navigation** — this tutorial uses `position: sticky` instead of `position: fixed`, which plays nicer with page layout
  - **Semantic HTML** — this tutorial adds `<main>`, `<header>`, and proper `<label>` associations that the basic tutorial skips
  - **CSS custom properties** — colors, spacing, and fonts are defined as variables so changes ripple through the whole stylesheet automatically
  - **Form feedback** — instead of a browser `alert()` popup, this tutorial builds a proper inline success/error message using DOM manipulation
  - **Scroll indicator** — a subtle animated chevron in the hero section cues visitors that more content is below the fold
  - **Accessibility** — `aria-label`, focus rings, and semantic elements are covered throughout

  The basic tutorial is a great single-page reference. This tutorial is a multi-step
  walkthrough designed to explain the *why* behind each decision, not just the *what*.
