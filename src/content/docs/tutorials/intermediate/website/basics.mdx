## Introduction

This page covers the foundational concepts behind how websites work — what files are
involved, how browsers render them, and what tools you need before writing a single
line of code. Nothing here requires prior programming experience, but familiarity
with basic file management will help. If you know how to create a folder and save a
file, you are already ahead of where most people start.

## Required Tools and Knowledge

Any computer purchased in the last decade is capable of building and testing a basic
website. No special hardware, no cloud subscription, no dedicated server — just a
filesystem, a text editor, and a browser. You probably already own everything you need,
which is a refreshing change from most hobbies.

---

### Hardware

There are no minimum performance requirements. A desktop, laptop, or server-class machine
running a supported OS will work. If it can open a browser and a text editor at the same
time without catching fire, it qualifies.

---

### Operating System

Recent releases of macOS, Linux/Unix distributions, and Windows all support the workflow
described in this tutorial. Pick your poison.

<Aside type="note" title="Platform Bias">
  Steps throughout this tutorial default to macOS and Linux CLI examples, because that
  is what the author uses and old habits die hard. Windows users can follow along using
  PowerShell, Git Bash, or WSL2 for an equivalent command-line environment.
</Aside>

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

All setup and file-management steps are shown as CLI commands. Point-and-click
equivalents exist for every step and are noted inline where the difference matters.
If you are new to the terminal, the [MDN command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line)
is a friendly place to start — it is less scary than it looks, and eventually you will
wonder how you lived without it.[^1]

### Web Browsers

Every modern browser implements the same HTML5/CSS3/ES6+ standards. Any of the
following will render this tutorial's output correctly. Pick the one that does not
make you feel vaguely judged:

<LinkCard title="Google Chrome" href="https://chrome.google.com" />
<LinkCard title="Mozilla Firefox" href="https://mozilla.org/firefox" />
<LinkCard title="Apple Safari" href="https://apple.com/safari" />
<LinkCard title="Microsoft Edge" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge" />

<Aside type="caution" title="A Word on Internet Explorer">
  Internet Explorer is end-of-life, does not support HTML5 semantic elements or modern
  CSS layout modules, and has not been relevant since the Obama administration.
  Do not use it for development, testing, or anything else. Ever.
</Aside>

### Text Editors

Web page source files must be saved as plain UTF-8 encoded text. Rich-text formats
like `.docx` or `.rtf` embed invisible formatting characters that break HTML parsing
in deeply confusing ways. Use a dedicated code editor from day one:

**GUI editors:** Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, CoffeeCup HTML Editor

**CLI editors:** Vim, Neovim, Nano, Emacs, Micro

Visual Studio Code is recommended for beginners due to its built-in syntax highlighting,
HTML tag completion, and live-preview extensions. Vim is recommended for people who
enjoy explaining to others how to exit Vim.[^2]

## How Web Content Works

### A Brief History

<Aside type="note" title="Historical Context">
  The early web was entirely plain text files marked up with HTML tags — no styling,
  no scripting, mostly text and links to other text. Somehow, people found this
  revolutionary. They were right.
</Aside>

Modern websites are still built on the same foundational technology. What has changed
is the sophistication of the CSS rendering engine and the JavaScript runtime embedded
in every browser. The core delivery mechanism — a browser requesting a file and
rendering the response — is unchanged since 1991. Tim Berners-Lee's original idea was
solid enough that thirty-plus years of engineers have not managed to replace it, only
pile things on top of it.

---

### Static vs. Dynamic Content

**Static content** is any file served exactly as it exists on disk: an HTML document,
a CSS stylesheet, a JavaScript file, an image. The server delivers the raw bytes; the
browser does all the rendering work. No database, no server-side processing, no moving
parts to break at 2 AM. Static sites are fast, cheap to host, and trivial to cache.
This tutorial builds a fully static site, which is a polite way of saying you will not
need to debug a database connection tonight.

**Dynamic content** is generated at request time by a server-side runtime (Node.js,
Python, PHP, etc.) pulling from a database and assembling an HTML response on the fly.
A CMS-backed blog, a shopping cart, or a user dashboard are common examples. Dynamic
content is outside the scope of this tutorial — there is plenty of complexity to enjoy
here first before opening that particular can of worms.

## How a Browser Loads a Page

When you open an HTML file — locally or from a remote URL — the browser executes this
sequence whether you ask it to or not:

1. **Parse HTML** — the browser reads the document top-to-bottom, building the Document
   Object Model (DOM), a tree representation of every element on the page.
2. **Fetch linked resources** — any `<link>`, `<script>`, or `<img>` tag referencing an
   external file triggers a separate file load.
3. **Apply CSS** — the browser constructs the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) from all loaded
   stylesheets and computes the final visual style of every DOM node.
4. **Execute JavaScript** — scripts run after the DOM is parsed, allowing code to read
   and modify page content dynamically.
5. **Render and paint** — the browser composites the styled DOM into pixels on screen
   and presents you with your creation, for better or worse.

Understanding this sequence pays off quickly when you start asking "why is my script
running before the element exists?" The answer is almost always step 2 versus step 4.

## Project File Anatomy

A minimal single-page website requires exactly three files. Not a monorepo, not a
dependency tree with 847 packages — three files:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Document structure and content |
| `style.css` | Visual presentation and layout |
| `script.js` | Runtime behavior and interactivity |

The filename `index.html` is a web server convention — it is the default document
returned when a browser requests a directory without specifying a filename. Use it as
your entry point, and never name your main page anything else unless you enjoy
explaining to people why the URL needs a filename appended.

---

### How Files Are Created

Text editors write source files to your local filesystem. The only requirements are
that the editor saves in plain-text UTF-8 format and that the file extension matches
the content type: `.html` for markup, `.css` for stylesheets, `.js` for scripts.
This is not a trick question, but it catches people off guard more often than it should.

---

### How Files Are Viewed Locally

Opening `index.html` directly in a browser via `File > Open` (or `open index.html` at
the CLI) works for basic rendering. For pages that load external resources or use the
`fetch()` API, browser security policy will block local file access. In those cases,
serve the files through a local HTTP server — the [setup page](/tutorials/build/setup/)
covers this.

---

### How Files Are Shared (Deployed)

Hosting a static site means copying your files to a web server or static hosting
platform. Common zero-cost options for learning projects include GitHub Pages, Netlify,
and Cloudflare Pages. Each accepts a folder of static files and hands you a public URL.
Deployment is covered in a later guide, after there is actually something worth deploying.

  The rest of this tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the concepts on this page.
  Keep it open as a reference — no shame in scrolling back. That is what it is here for.
